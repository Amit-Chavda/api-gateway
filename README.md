## API Gateway

> An API Gateway is a server that acts as an API front-end, receiving API requests, enforcing throttling and security policies, passing requests to the back-end service, and then passing the response back to the requester. It acts as a reverse proxy to accept all application programming interface (API) calls, aggregate the various services required to fulfill them, and return the appropriate result.

## Purpose

- **Centralized Management**:
  - **Routing**: API Gateways can route requests to the appropriate microservices based on the request URL. 
  - **Load Balancing**: They distribute incoming traffic across multiple service instances to ensure optimal resource utilization and prevent overload on any single service. 
  - **Versioning**: API Gateways can manage different versions of APIs and route requests to the correct version.
- **Security and Authentication**:
  - **Authentication and Authorization**: API Gateways can handle authentication mechanisms, ensuring that only authorized users or systems can access certain services.
  - **Encryption**: They can enforce encryption for data in transit using HTTPS.
- **Monitoring and Analytics:**
  - **Logging**: API Gateways can log requests and responses, providing valuable insights into traffic patterns and potential issues.
  - **Monitoring**: They can monitor the health and performance of services, ensuring high availability.
  - **Analytics**: API Gateways can collect data on API usage, helping organizations make data-driven decisions.
  Response Modification and Transformation:
- **Caching and Optimization**:
  - **Caching**: API Gateways can cache responses from services, reducing the load on backend systems and improving response times.
  - **Compression**: They can compress responses to reduce bandwidth usage.

## How to Access the API Gateway

The API Gateway is hosted at [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
